# Orbital2022
~Deployment: https://playbay-client.herokuapp.com/~

Heroku has ceased it's operation. Unfortunately, we are not intending to redeploy on another platform.

1. Clone and pull git repository.
2. Change directory to /Client and run 'npm install' to install node modules for frontend.
3. Change directory to /Server and run 'npm install' again to install node modules for backend.
4. To activate the webpage, be in the directory /Server and run 'npm run dev'.

NOTE: our .env file is not in the repo. The webpage will not be able to run. For testing, head to the deployment!.
